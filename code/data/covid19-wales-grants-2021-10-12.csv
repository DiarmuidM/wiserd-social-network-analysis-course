As a particularly high risk group, we would like to ensure that we can use our extensive experience and skills to safeguarding older victim-survivors. 3) To have the capacity to refine and expand our online training to include further in-depth information on the intersection between these two areas of vulnerability during a period of social distancing and lock-down. 4) to test and evaluate the safety planning toolkit and capture the contextual factors that facilitate a sense of a safer space and increase options for positive social connections. 5) Informed by the production of our LGBTQ films on domestic abuse in later life, we would like to use the partnerships we have developed to produce YouTube videos aimed at supporting older LGBTQ groups during this period of increased isolation. The funding would increase the capacity of staff to add a dementia strand to any short films aimed at different target audiences who want to learn more about older victim-survivors. Furthermore if the short YouTube films generated sufficient interest we would use our current online forums to create weekly chats aimed specifically to support different groups within LGBTQ communities. We are proposing an additional five- months funding to extend our service and to expand our learning on how to create safety tool-kits where domestic abuse and dementia co-exist. We will use the learning to offer a range of training tools online to front-line practitioners and volunteers on how to respond to the co-existence of dementia and domestic abuse during Covid-19.

360G-CR-4908685,Young men?s Online Support,"COVID19 -We are increasingly concerned that the Covid 19 pandemic is having a detrimental impact on the mental health and recovery of the young people we support. The young people we support through our Comic Relief funding have all suffered or are at risk of suffering a psychotic episode. Around 1 in 100 people will develop a full psychotic episode in their lifetime. The vast majority (8 out of 10) will experience their first episode between the ages of 15 and 30. It affects men and women equally and seems to be more common in city areas and in some ethnic minority groups. 
 Psychosis can have an extremely damaging impact on a young person?s wellbeing and quality of life. It can affect their relationships with friends and family, and their ability to engage in education, training and employment. It also makes it very difficult to manage everyday tasks, like paying bills or rent. All of these problems are exacerbated by the lockdown and Covid-19 Crisis. There are significant personal, social and health impacts of psychosis when treatment and support is not effective. The lockdown has restricted our ability to provide effective support on a face to face basis. We are very worried about the long term impact of the disruption to the service on the people we support.
 Now that we are unable to provide face to face delivery, we are requesting funding to continue this work virtually. We will use funding to establish:
 - A custom-built section on our ?Clic? website. Clic offers a safe and secure place online to support each other, share experiences and build new relationships ? in either English or Welsh. The site also signposts people to useful information, contacts, resources and local services. The online community will include a safe, regulated supported forum where users can create a profile, connect with others, comment on a number of threads and make friends, thus reducing social isolation. Funding will contribute towards a dedicated section for young people to provide peer support; specialist time to produce relevant information and guidance for this cohort and increased staff time to allow for 24 hour moderation. 
 - Training to Young People and importantly, their carers or parents on how to keep active and social through digital inclusion skills.

360G-CheshireCF-A569158,NTC Reopening Project,"1. The Neuro Therapy Centre supports people who are vulnerable due to their long term, degenerative neurological condition for whom there is little statutory support in the region. We also support their Carers to care and maintain own physical health and mental wellbeing. 2. By taking into account social distancing and PPE requirements, the project will ensure the re-introduction of safe access to group physiotherapy, fitness & exercise, and Oxygen Therapy for individuals with neurological conditions on site at our premises in Saltney. This support will initially be by invitation only and will target the ongoing needs of those individuals who are most isolated and vulnerable, and who may not have engaged virtually due to physical, financial and/or IT and other barriers, in order to ensure their health and wellbeing needs are being met. 3. Grant funding will be used to contribute towards the cost of social distancing measures, PPE, IT and other operational requirements to ensure safe access to face-to-face services on-site in Saltney, in compliance with Government Guidance, as well as the NTCâs own Reopening Policy and Visitor Guidelines. 4. The focus of our project is the improved inclusion of âhighâ and âmoderateâ risk individuals with a long term, degenerative neurological condition, at a time when many are more vulnerable to infection and at risk of exclusion and isolation due to COVID-19, and we believe our preventative philosophy and transformational response to the pandemic closely aligns with the CCF COVID-19 Response Grants programme - Longer Term Emergency Phase focus of supporting organisations to adapt to the crisis. By taking this preventative approach, we want to reintroduce face-to-face exercise opportunities and other support required to enable them to manage their symptoms, limit further physical and mental deterioration due to their condition, and help them recover from the negative effects of the pandemic, whilst also ensuring they are safe and protected. This project will support improved health and wellbeing, and address the needs of the most isolated of our community many of whom will not have been out of their homes since lock-down started. 5. The impact of the pandemic has been significant on our income, which has reduced because of cancelled fundraising events, reduced subsidised contributions from members towards on-site face to face classes which have all ceased, and reduced revenue from our Community CafÃ©. Significant support has however been secured from the Steve Morgan Foundation to offset lost income for the period April to September 20, and other funding has been secured for the Emergency Phase 1 of the 'Virtual Centre' so our funding request does NOT include a support for financial stability.",GBP,12874.08,08/09/2020,GB-COH-02269526,Neuro Therapy Centre,GB-CHC-1143711,Cheshire Community Foundation,DCMS Covid-19 Response Ph 2,360G-cheshirecf,Cheshire Community Foundation,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0),GB-CHC-700904,NEURO THERAPY CENTRE LTD,registered-charity,542429,FALSE,FALSE,W06000005,Flintshire,W06000005,Flintshire,,,W92000004,Wales,53.17840953,-2.943202028,beneficiaryLocation,03:24.7

360G-WCVA-27834,Third Sector Resilience Fund Phase 2,"COVID19 has had a detrimental impact on our organisation and business and continues to do so with a continuation of significant losses in our income streams across all business functions and avenues with particular concerns and a turn around required for our Soft Play Centre  which is purely customer base income driven.   As an organisation who have seen significant growth, impact and positivity over the last 5-years, a significant detrimental impact has been borne due to the COVID crisis which will jeopardise the entire organisation should survival funding not be sourced. We have seen an approximate 50% reduction in our income this year (Â£450k), however have been fortunate to have accessed a number or resources and lifelines to reduce the funding gap.  By accessing a variety of support mechanisms including furlough, phase-1 resilience funding and additional emergency funding we have been able to minimise the impact.  In addition to the funding obtained we have undertaken a whole organisational-restructure and have been working with staff encouraging where possible to find alternative employment.  From a pre-COVID staffing of 68 we currently have a staffing of 53.  It is unfortunate that we were in a position and required to issue three redundancy notices, however, two other staff secured roles elsewhere and 10 casual staff contracts were temporarily suspended however we are hopeful of their return when the current situation allows.  The actions we have taken as an organisation demonstrate how we are able to minimise organisational risk in challenging circumstances however we are still required to bridge a gap during a time where COVID is still affecting our ability to operate safely.  We are extremely confident we can ride the storm with financial support allowing us capacity and leeway to increase our customer numbers and gain the trust and confidence in returning.  Without the support, we will not have the cash flow to fulfill our financial obligations.    Taking this into account 85% of our request will be to support the organisational financial gap (approx 18% of our loss of revenue), having made realistic efficiency savings to date. This support will allow us to survive. The 15% of our request will allow us improve the facilities and investments we had made to our offer prior to COVID and help us get us back on the positive trajectory we were on pre March 2020.
