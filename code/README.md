# Interactive coding materials

We have developed a number of Jupyter notebooks containing a mix of Python code, narrative and output.

If you would like to run and/or edit the code without installing any software on your machine, click on the button below. This launches a **Binder** service allowing you to interact with the code through your web browser - as it is temporary, you will lose your work when you log out and you will be booted out if you donâ€™t do anything for a long time.

Once Binder has been launched, click on the notebook you want to run. (*Don't worry if takes up to a minute to launch*)

### Launch Social Network Analysis as a Binder service: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DiarmuidM/wiserd-social-network-analysis-course/main?filepath=code)

### Google Colab

Alternatively you can run the notebooks through Google Colab (requires a Google account):
