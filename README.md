# Social Network Analysis

## Introduction

Vast swathes of our social interactions and personal behaviours are now conducted online and/or captured digitally. Thus, computational methods for collecting, cleaning and analysing data are an increasingly important component of a social scientistâ€™s toolkit. Social Network Analysis (SNA) offers a rich and insightful methododolgical approach for uncovering and understanding social structures, relations and networks of assocation.

This training series, run over two half days, introduces participants to core concepts, data structures, and methods of analysis associated with SNA. The training consists of a mix of lectures, coding demonstrations, practical exercises, and group discussions. The training is suitable for individuals new to SNA and looking to gain a good grounding in the fundamentals of this methodology.
